# structured-log Client-side Example

This example is a very simple web page that includes an example setup and usage of *structured-log*.

To run, first change directory to where the example is (where this *readme* is): 

	cd examples/browser 

Then run a web server of your choice.

I recommend that you install [*http-server*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) globally, it's great for testing. 

	http-server

Then navigate your browser to *index.html* at *localhost*. If you are using *http-server* then by default this will be [http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html).

Open up your developer console. If you are using *Google Chrome* hit F12 and select the *Console* tab.

You should now see examples of logging that were output from *app.js*.
